2. Click "SEARCH" button.
3. The page will show all returns for that period. Find "GSTR-1" tile.
4. Click "PREPARE ONLINE" if you have fewer than 500 invoices. Click "PREPARE OFFLINE" if you have 500+ invoices (you'll download the offline tool, import the JSON from this app, and upload).
5. For QRMP scheme users: Select the quarter end month. You file quarterly but can use IFF (Invoice Furnishing Facility) monthly for B2B invoices.
NOTE: GSTR-1 must be filed BEFORE GSTR-3B. Due date: 11th of next month (monthly filers) or 13th of month after quarter (QRMP).`

   • Invoice Date — DD/MM/YYYY format. Must fall within the return period.
   • Invoice Value — Total invoice amount INCLUDING tax (the "Total" column in B2B table above).
   • Place of Supply — Select the state. For intra-state, this is YOUR state. For inter-state, this is the BUYER's state.
   • Reverse Charge — Select "N" (No) for normal supplies. Select "Y" only if the buyer pays GST under reverse charge (Section 9(3)/9(4)).
   • Invoice Type — "Regular" for normal invoices, "SEZ supplies with payment" / "SEZ supplies without payment" for SEZ.
   • Click "ADD" under tax details → Enter Rate (e.g., 18%), Taxable Value, IGST or CGST+SGST amounts.
4. Click "SAVE" after each invoice.
5. Repeat for ALL B2B invoices.
